This script will parse out geo coordinates from Google's Takeout Location History JSON file

The way this works:
1. Load JSON file location string as an input
2. Script will parse out the following coords startLocation, endLocation for both Lat and Long coords
3. Script will store startLocation and endLocation coords as a data frame.
